KG_TRIPLET_EXTRACT_TMPL = """
-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

3. Output Formatting:
- Return the result in valid JSON format with two keys: 'entities' (list of entity objects) and 'relationships' (list of relationship objects).
- Exclude any text outside the JSON structure (e.g., no explanations or comments).
- If no entities or relationships are identified, return empty lists: { "entities": [], "relationships": [] }.

-An Output Example-
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "Albert Einstein",
      "entity_type": "Person",
      "entity_description": "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity and made significant contributions to physics."
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "Theory of Relativity",
      "entity_type": "Scientific Theory",
      "entity_description": "A scientific theory developed by Albert Einstein, describing the laws of physics in relation to observers in different frames of reference."
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "Nobel Prize in Physics",
      "entity_type": "Award",
      "entity_description": "A prestigious international award in the field of physics, awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source_entity": "Albert Einstein",
      "target_entity": "Theory of Relativity",
      "relation": "developed",
      "relationship_description": "Albert Einstein is the developer of the theory of relativity."
    },
    {
      "source_entity": "Albert Einstein",
      "target_entity": "Nobel Prize in Physics",
      "relation": "won",
      "relationship_description": "Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
